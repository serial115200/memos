Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is often interchanged or confused with Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC). But GMT is a time zone and UTC is a time standard.

Although GMT and UTC share the same current time in practice, there is a basic
difference between the two:

* GMT is a time zone officially used in some European and African countries. The
  time can be displayed using both the 24-hour format (0 - 24) or the 12-hour
  format (1 - 12 am/pm).
* UTC is not a time zone, but a time standard that is the basis for civil time
  and time zones worldwide. This means that no country or territory officially
  uses UTC as a local time.
